# Web_in_rust
A full stack of Web writing in rust, which copy from yangxu's course in bilibili, then make some change later.

All in rust. A project for practice.

Something is funny when you add some file outside the .git, it will catch you in trouble to deal the conflit of commit message and Merge.
