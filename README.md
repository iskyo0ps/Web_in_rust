# Web_in_rust
A full stack of Web writing in rust, which copy from yangxu's course in bilibili, then make some change later.

All in rust. A project for practice.

Something is funny when you add some file outside the .git, it will catch you in trouble to deal the conflit of commit message and Merge.

Task in list as follows:
- [ ] Cargo run in $/project/ws/webservice;
- [ ] Establish a posrgresql in local system，maybe I will write a brief intro about this;
- [ ] Fail to parse manifest at Some cargo.toml files;
- [ ] $project\ws> cargo test --bin teacher-service
